# item-shadow-fixes
So, we all know that shadow items are really cool. And you want to allow people to use them on your server. Only one problem: item shadowing is full of duplication bugs as well. The goal of this mod is to patch out these duplication bugs while still allowing the usage of shadow items.

Will probably also contain some fixes for duplication from update suppression as well.
